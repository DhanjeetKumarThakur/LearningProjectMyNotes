# LearningProjectMyNotes

This project is created using Spring boot with MVC Architecture.
- I have used SQLLite3 as db 
- I have used Thymeleaf engine at Frontend along with HTML, CSS and BootStrap 4.5


If someone who wants to run this application can directly download and run in their IDE's without changing any configurations. As i have used SQLLite3 for Database it doesn't need any username and passwords. So it make easy to use without any much setup.
